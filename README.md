Hey!  I work as a Technical Program Manager within **Microsoft's Commercial Software Engineering organization**, helping customers and partners develop solutions based on the Microsoft Azure platform. Iâ€™m as old as I look, with over 20 yearsâ€™ experience as a Microsoft software developer. Iâ€™m passionate about the Intelligent Cloud and creating new experiences using a range of Microsoft technologies. I have a degree from the university of life and once read some books (I also have a real degree).

My first ever ðŸ’» computer was a Spectrum 48k (yep the rubber key version), where I learnt to copy lines of code out of a book to produce non-working games with endless frustration. Today, I still sometimes experience the same frustration coding, but at least the debug experience is much better :)

I build stuff mostly in C#, and occasionally work in other languages such as C, nodejs and python.
